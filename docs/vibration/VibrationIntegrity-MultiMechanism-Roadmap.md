# Vibration Integrity — Multi-Mechanism Roadmap

## 1. Purpose

The complete retained EI AVIFF worked-example set establishes that Flow-Induced Turbulence (FIT) is one mechanism inside a wider line-based vibration screening report. The product architecture therefore uses shared line/case engineering basis plus independent mechanism assessments rather than treating FIT as the application-level data model.

This roadmap records architecture, evidence coverage, qualification boundaries and implementation sequence. It is not an engineering-authority promotion document.

## 2. Controlled source basis

```

Source terminology such as “Screening Report” does not authorize this application as a screening/design authority.

## 3. Authority freeze

```text
FIT calculationState      = IMPLEMENTED
FIT qualificationState    = BENCHMARK_ONLY
engineeringAuthority      = NONE
screeningAuthority        = NOT_AUTHORIZED
designAuthority           = false

all non-FIT mechanisms    = NOT_IMPLEMENTED
```

No roadmap stage changes this without an explicit engineering-governance decision.

## 4. Product architecture

```text
Facility assessment
  -> line / operating case
     -> shared engineering basis
     -> mechanism assessments
        -> FIT
        -> Mechanical excitation
        -> Reciprocating / PD pulsation
        -> Rotating stall
        -> Deadleg pulsation
        -> Corrugated-pipe pulsation
        -> Slug flow
        -> AIV
        -> Valve transients
        -> Cavitation / flashing
        -> Thermowells
        -> Small-bore connections
     -> implemented governing result
     -> evidence / traceability
```

Mechanisms may contain zero, one or many child assessment items. A future generic mechanism model must support that cardinality.

## 5. Retained worked-example evidence matrix

| Mechanism | Retained populated example evidence | Current numerical state |
|---|---|---|
| FIT | Yes | IMPLEMENTED / BENCHMARK_ONLY |
| Mechanical excitation | Yes | NOT_IMPLEMENTED |
| Reciprocating / PD pulsation | No populated retained rows | NOT_IMPLEMENTED |
| Rotating stall | No populated retained rows | NOT_IMPLEMENTED |
| Deadleg pulsation | Yes | NOT_IMPLEMENTED |
| Corrugated-pipe pulsation | No populated retained rows | NOT_IMPLEMENTED |
| Slug flow | No populated retained rows | NOT_IMPLEMENTED |
| AIV | Yes | NOT_IMPLEMENTED |
| Valve transients | Yes | NOT_IMPLEMENTED |
| Cavitation / flashing | No populated retained rows | NOT_IMPLEMENTED |
| Thermowells | Yes | NOT_IMPLEMENTED |
| Small-bore connections | Yes | NOT_IMPLEMENTED |

An empty retained section is not qualification evidence.

## 6. Shared engineering basis

The authoritative editable data remains the canonical topology / operating / enrichment working state.

The primary Engineering-basis projection is joined from that state using production-equivalent FIT planning semantics. It must not become a second editable store.

Shared basis includes identity, pipe/process quantities and reusable derived context only where there is an adopted central calculation/source contract. FIT-specific calculations remain inside FIT.

## 7. UI target

```text
Source / working state
  -> Engineering basis
  -> FIT readiness / run
  -> facility mechanism matrix
  -> selected line/mechanism detail
  -> Source Data / evidence
```

Facility result matrix:

```text
Line | Case | Shared status |
FIT | Mechanical | Recip/PD | Rotating stall | Deadlegs | Corrugations |
Slug | AIV | Transients | Cav/Flash | Thermowells | SBC |
Implemented governing | Qualification | Review
```

Only FIT may currently display a calculated value.

Selected-row detail:

```text
Summary | Inputs | Calculation | Case | Evidence | Source | Diagnostics
```

`Calculation` is currently the explicit FIT mechanism calculation trace.

## 8. State dimensions

### Input authority

- `COMPLETE_XLSX_UNTOUCHED`
- `LIMITED_ELEMENTS_ONLY`
- `UNVERIFIED_ELEMENTS_CSV`
- `LOCAL_EDITED_ELEMENTS`

### Mechanism implementation

- `NOT_IMPLEMENTED`
- `IMPLEMENTED_BENCHMARK_ONLY`
- future qualification/authorized states only after explicit governance

### Applicability/readiness

- `NOT_EVALUATED`
- `APPLICABILITY_UNKNOWN`
- `NOT_APPLICABLE`
- `APPLICABLE_INCOMPLETE`
- `READY`
- `CALCULATED`
- `FAILED`
- `REVIEW_REQUIRED`

`NOT_IMPLEMENTED` is not an applicability result.

### Result currency

- `UNRUN`
- `READY`
- `RUNNING`
- `CURRENT_RESULT`
- `STALE_RESULT`
- `INVALID_INPUT`

Presentation-only navigation/filter/sort changes do not stale engineering results.

## 9. Traceability target

```text
facility run
  -> line assessment
  -> mechanism assessment item
  -> mechanism result
  -> equation / correlation / rule ID
  -> normalized engineering input
  -> working input cell
  -> original input cell
  -> source record
  -> controlled source identity
```

FIT Stage 4 now exposes stable correlation IDs, equation IDs, normalized central inputs and calculation intermediates. Stage 3 supplies deterministic working-cell/source anchors.

### Stage 6 — Mechanical excitation

Status: **NEXT AFTER STAGE-5 RELEASE/BROWSER EVIDENCE**

Use retained records 3, 4, 5 and 7 only after adopted rules/equations, equipment-item cardinality, governing semantics, independent examples and unit invariance are controlled. Authority starts benchmark-only.

### Stage 7 — Deadleg pulsation

Use retained records 4, 7 and 8. Control branch geometry, standard/advanced paths, unavailable advanced results, branch-mainline trace, independent checks and boundaries.

### Stage 8 — AIV

Use retained records 5, 6 and 8. Control valve/noise source contract, PWL, low-noise trim, pressure/flow resolution and independent qualification separately from FIT.

### Stage 9 — Valve transients

Use retained records 7, 8 and 12. Control mechanism taxonomy, valve/pump context, closure/opening forces, pressure rise, opening/closing LOF and source ambiguity.

### Stage 10 — Thermowell / SBC

Treat both as child-item mechanisms. Thermowell requires ASME PTC 19.3 TW qualification. SBC requires mainline dependency plus fitting/location/geometry evidence.

### Stage 11 — Mechanisms with no retained populated examples

Do not implement from empty headings:

- reciprocating / PD pulsation;
- rotating stall;
- corrugated-pipe pulsation;
- slug flow;
- cavitation / flashing.

Each needs an adopted method source plus independent qualification evidence.

### Stage 12 — Screening-authority review

Separate engineering-governance event requiring adopted screening scope, mechanism-specific independent validation, boundary/domain coverage, unit invariance, source/run trace, exact-head release/browser validation, independent vibration-engineer approval and explicit Owner authority transition.

No design authority is implied by screening promotion.

## 11. Coding / authority rules

1. One numerical path only.
2. UI never becomes solver authority.
3. One authoritative editable state; projections do not duplicate it.
4. No silent engineering defaults.
5. No blank-to-zero conversion.
6. `NOT_IMPLEMENTED` never becomes `NOT_APPLICABLE`.
7. Source/mechanism child items have stable IDs.
8. Source ambiguity fails closed.
9. Expected benchmark outputs remain independent of production code.
10. New abstractions require a real production consumer in the same PR.
11. No universal vibration/risk/confidence score.
12. Authority changes require explicit durable decision and focused validation.
13. Exact value revert does not restore lost topology source authority.
14. Stale results are evidence only; export/parity require `CURRENT_RESULT`.
15. FIT-specific geometry remains mechanism-specific until legitimately shared by another qualified mechanism.
16. Cross-table identity editing requires an explicit atomic contract.
17. Stable correlation/rule IDs are metadata; they must not change numerical method semantics.
18. Calculation detail renders backend intermediates; UI must not reproduce engineering formulas.

## 12. Current release gate

Controlled command:

```bash
npm run verify:vibration-fit-release
```

After Stage 5 the manifest contains **39 controlled test files**.

Focused Stage-5 framework validation is PASS. Full exact-head release execution, real-browser interaction and independent vibration-engineering review remain required before authority closure.
