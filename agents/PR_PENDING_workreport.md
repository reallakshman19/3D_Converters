| Exact next action | Publish the bounded Stage-4 diff, allocate draft PR, rename this report, then verify exact PR diff and automation status. |

## Handover in 60 Seconds

Stages 1–3 are already on `main` via merged PR #442. AIV PR #444 also merged before this follow-on branch was created. This PR is deliberately independent and based on the post-AIV `main`.

Stage 4 makes FIT explicitly inspectable as one mechanism without creating another solver path:

```text
shared Engineering basis
  -> existing facility FIT workflow
  -> central Engineering Calculation API
  -> FIT result envelope
  -> FIT mechanism detail model
  -> Calculation tab
```

The Calculation tab renders only values already returned by the central result:

- normalized/resolved inputs;
- hydraulic intermediates and velocity source;
- `rhoV2` excitation evidence;
- viscosity factor and standard demand;
- support boundaries, stiffness and category;
- standard and advanced correlation traces;
- advanced eligibility reason/range;
- standard/refined/governing LOF and reference band;
- equation IDs, stable correlation IDs and controlled source provenance.

The FIT numerical files `converters/vibration/fit/method.js` and `converters/vibration/fit/calculate.js` are intentionally unchanged.

## Authority Freeze

```text
FIT calculationState      = IMPLEMENTED
FIT qualificationState    = BENCHMARK_ONLY
engineeringAuthority      = NONE
screeningAuthority        = NOT_AUTHORIZED
designAuthority           = false
```

No UI text or trace identifier may imply screening/design authorization.

## Engineering Item Register

| ID | Type | Status | Summary |
|---|---|---|---|
| IMP-001 | Improvement | IMPLEMENTED | Add stable correlation trace IDs outside the numerical correlation implementation. |
| IMP-002 | Improvement | IMPLEMENTED | Expose central FIT intermediates and advanced eligibility through the adapter result envelope. |
| IMP-003 | Improvement | IMPLEMENTED | Add an explicit workspace FIT mechanism detail model. |
| IMP-004 | Improvement | IMPLEMENTED | Add a Calculation tab sourced only from backend result data. |
| RISK-001 | Risk | MITIGATED | UI must not recompute FIT quantities; new renderer contains no solver/math path. |
| RISK-002 | Risk | MITIGATED | Stable trace IDs must not alter correlation coefficients/equations. |
| RISK-003 | Risk | MITIGATED | Follow-on work must not overwrite merged AIV #444 changes; branch is based on post-#444 main and touches no AIV files. |
| DEC-001 | Decision | ACCEPTED | Stable correlation IDs live in `fit/trace.js`, not `method.js`. |
| DEC-002 | Decision | ACCEPTED | Central adapter attaches correlation IDs/intermediates; workspace UI only renders them. |
| DEC-003 | Decision | ACCEPTED | Detail sequence is Summary / Inputs / Calculation / Case / Evidence / Source / Diagnostics. |
| DEC-004 | Decision | ACCEPTED | Roadmap Stage 5 remains next only after current exact-head release/browser validation. |
| QST-001 | Qualification | OPEN | Full 36-test exact-head release gate remains required. |
| QST-002 | Qualification | OPEN | Real browser verification of Calculation tab and stale/current interaction remains required. |

## Stable FIT Correlation IDs

Standard:

```text
FIT.STD.STIFF.v1
FIT.STD.MEDIUM_STIFF.v1
FIT.STD.MEDIUM_SMALL.v1
FIT.STD.MEDIUM_LARGE.v1
FIT.STD.FLEXIBLE_SMALL.v1
FIT.STD.FLEXIBLE_LARGE.v1
```

Advanced:

```text
FIT.ADV.FLEXIBLE_SMALL.v1
FIT.ADV.FLEXIBLE_LARGE.v1
```

These IDs identify already-selected backend correlation branches. They do not select a branch and do not contain numerical formulas.

## Controlled Source Basis

FIT controlled method/reference source remains:

```text
reallaksh19/CRF-4-1
commit 68dc8e1fa2ef67073c59b3afc56f1bf40953d535
Extended calc2/AIV FIV/FIT.xlsm
blob d7d4c1a773fe1b2e9791f258b2b7a07e95bdc41e
sheet Flow Induced Turbulence
```

Full EI worked-example context retained on `main` originates from:

```text
reallaksh19/Common
commit fb549185b9b27edc2379734240320a85c5bef9f6
Energy-Institute-AVIFF---Worked-Examples.doc.docx
blob ceee15ed5f7f320045d5f3979024e2e8664613f2
```

Benchmark authority remains the existing controlled five-case FIT set and independent hand benchmark evidence. Stage 4 creates no new expected numerical targets.

## Stage Execution Log

### Stage 0 — Pre-flight / repository reconciliation
**COMPLETE / PASS.** PR #442 was observed merged while Stage 4 was being prepared. PR #444 then advanced `main`. Current target was re-resolved to `main@90d504f74f872f232378836f72c2544297dea8c8` before publication.

Shared FIT/workspace files were re-read from the post-#444 main. The Stage-4 targets remain compatible; no AIV file is in scope.

### Stage 1 — FIT mechanism extraction
**PARTIAL.** Implementation and focused validation are complete locally; full repository/browser gates remain NOT_RUN.

Implemented:

- `converters/vibration/fit/trace.js`
  - stable standard/advanced correlation IDs;
  - fail-closed unknown path/category behavior;
  - no numerical calculation.
- central FIT engineering adapter
  - retains existing outputs;
  - adds backend correlation trace IDs;
  - exposes standard demand/LOF, advanced eligibility/path and existing hydraulic/support intermediates.
- `converters/vibration/workspace/fit-detail.js`
  - explicit `VibrationWorkspaceFitDetail.v1` projection from `centralResult`;
  - no recomputation.
- workspace detail integration
  - selected result row now carries `fitMechanism` detail.
- `tabs/vibration-integrity-fit-detail-view.js`
  - Calculation renderer sourced only from `fitMechanism`;
  - normalized inputs, hydraulic/excitation/support/correlation/result/provenance sections.
- main detail tabs
  - new `Calculation` tab;
  - evidence view also displays correlation IDs.
- docs/roadmap updated for Stage-4 completion state and Stage-5 next state.
- controlled FIT/VIB release manifest expanded from 34 to 36 test files.

## Focused Validation

PASS:

```text
node --test \
  tests/vibration-fit-correlation-trace.test.mjs \
  tests/vibration-integrity-fit-mechanism.test.mjs \
  tests/vibration-integrity-detail-view.test.mjs

15 tests / 15 PASS
```

PASS:

- `node --check` on all changed Stage-4 production/test JavaScript;
- new/modified JS modules remain under 300 physical lines;
- no `Math.*`, FIT solver, or engineering-calculation call in the new Calculation renderer;
- no modifications to `fit/method.js` or `fit/calculate.js`.

`[SIMULATED]` PASS:

```text
vibration-fit-release-gate.test.mjs
5 / 5 PASS
```

This simulation verifies the intended 36-path release manifest shape/uniqueness with local placeholders only. It is **not** evidence that the actual 36-file repository suite passed.

NOT_RUN:

```text
npm run verify:vibration-fit-release
whole-repository integration suite
real browser Calculation tab
real browser normalized-input / source / stale-current interaction
all five benchmark cases through exact new head
independent vibration-engineering review
```

## Exact Intended Changed-File Ledger — 16 paths

1. `agents/PR_PENDING_workreport.md` — temporary living CodingRules report; rename after PR allocation.
2. `converters/engineering-calculations/adapters/vibration-fit.js` — attach backend FIT trace/intermediate evidence.
3. `converters/vibration/fit/index.js` — export FIT trace contract.
4. `converters/vibration/fit/trace.js` — NEW stable correlation trace IDs; non-numerical.
5. `converters/vibration/workspace/detail.js` — attach FIT mechanism detail to selected workspace row.
6. `converters/vibration/workspace/fit-detail.js` — NEW explicit FIT detail projection.
7. `docs/vibration/VibrationIntegrity-FIT-Mechanism-v1.md` — NEW Stage-4 product/trace contract.
8. `docs/vibration/VibrationIntegrity-MultiMechanism-Roadmap.md` — Stage 4 implemented, Stage 5 next.
9. `docs/vibration/VibrationIntegrityTab-v1.md` — seven-tab detail/Calculation contract.
10. `scripts/verify-vibration-fit-release.mjs` — release manifest 34 -> 36 tests.
11. `tabs/vibration-integrity-detail-view.js` — add Calculation tab/delegation and correlation IDs in evidence.
12. `tabs/vibration-integrity-fit-detail-view.js` — NEW backend-only FIT Calculation renderer.
13. `tests/vibration-fit-correlation-trace.test.mjs` — NEW trace-ID/fail-closed regression.
14. `tests/vibration-fit-release-gate.test.mjs` — pin 36-test release manifest.
15. `tests/vibration-integrity-detail-view.test.mjs` — seven-tab/Calculation/evidence regression.
16. `tests/vibration-integrity-fit-mechanism.test.mjs` — NEW FIT detail-model/renderer boundary regression.

After PR allocation, path 1 is replaced by `agents/PR<NUMBER>_workreport.md`; final PR diff remains 16 paths.

## Engineering Invariants

- **INV-001:** one numerical FIT path only: facility workflow -> central Engineering Calculation API -> existing FIT kernel.
- **INV-002:** UI never calls or reimplements FIT numerical equations.
- **INV-003:** stable correlation IDs identify backend-selected paths; they never select the path.
- **INV-004:** `method.js` and `calculate.js` numerical behavior remain unchanged in Stage 4.
- **INV-005:** Calculation tab shows backend values verbatim and preserves unavailable/null states.
- **INV-006:** advanced eligibility is distinct from advanced result availability.
- **INV-007:** equation IDs and correlation IDs remain separate trace dimensions.
- **INV-008:** FIT remains `BENCHMARK_ONLY`; traceability does not promote authority.
- **INV-009:** non-FIT mechanism state is untouched by this PR.
- **INV-010:** merged AIV #444 files are outside the Stage-4 changed-file scope.

## Next-Agent Handover

After PR allocation, use the PR-specific work report as the single source of truth. Verify the final 16-file diff, current-head automation status, then run in a normal checkout:

```bash
npm install
npm run verify:vibration-fit-release
```

Browser-check all five controlled FIT cases, Calculation tab values/IDs/provenance, standard-only and advanced-eligible states, source/evidence tabs, and `CURRENT_RESULT -> STALE_RESULT -> CURRENT_RESULT` behavior.

Proceed to Roadmap Stage 5 only after those gates are recorded. Merge only with explicit Owner authorization.
