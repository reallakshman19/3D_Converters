# PR348 — XML229 native Run continuation — 28 October 2026

HANDOVER_READINESS: READY
PR_RECOVERY_STATE: HEALTHY
TAKEOVER_AUTHORITY: WRITE_ALLOWED (direct Owner continuation; new follow-up, no takeover of an open PR)
PR_HEAD_OBSERVED: 95a82a9d80b810da5c4207d472971634a0d6634f
REPORT_BASIS_HEAD: 95a82a9d80b810da5c4207d472971634a0d6634f
REPORT_SYNC: CURRENT
APPENDIX_A_STATUS: CURRENT (continuation challenges below; incoming implementer must independently qualify)
MERGE_BASE: e83a7bae22a1ab91e671c56072c9777c86ba1477
MAIN_HEAD_LAST_CHECKED: e83a7bae22a1ab91e671c56072c9777c86ba1477
GROUNDING_EPOCH: GE-NATIVE-RUN-20261028-1
CURRENT_STAGE: VALIDATE / DRAFT DELIVERY
CURRENT_BLOCKER: Owner private source/session is not available; audit omits actual Run eligibility and the production action does not record candidate attempts.
HIGHEST_RISK: Mistaking completed Weight/Final review for verified native output.
EXACT_NEXT_ACTION: Verify targeted exact-head GitHub Node22/24 and Chromium checks; inspect Owner live native execution after integration. Never clear the native gate from this report.

## Mission and authority

Owner reports 98 Final, 686 facts, zero unresolved, eligible Final intent, but disabled CII download. Continue the authorized robust fix through a reviewable draft PR. Generate output only through the existing native converter and independent reconciliation. Never manufacture CII or authorization from audit evidence. No merge, release-policy, mass, writer, classification, topology, original-fixture or workflow mutation.

## Ground truth and coordination

- PR347 is merged at main e83a7bae; its Final-intent observation correction is present. Historical Draft status is superseded.
- agents/MASTER_INDEX.md does not exist on current main (404); root AGENTS.md and .agents/AGENTS.md read.
- Open PR329 (90f8a7b1) and PR312 overlap output-run/native domain. Direct Owner follow-up is based on current main, does not mutate those branches and must be reconciled before either older branch integrates. PR315 owns weight-draft presentation; PR346 owns standalone topology and is excluded. Existing topology claim is for merged PR344, not an exclusive current Run claim. Coordination classification: COORDINATION_REQUIRED at integration; bounded current-main follow-up authorized by Owner.
- Git clone unavailable (403); exact-main files retrieved through GitHub connector. Local Git is a source-subset diff workspace, not the complete upstream history.

## Evidence and open items

- ISS-1 USER_SUPPLIED: audit validates all 98 Final masses and eligible intent; nativeCandidate null, no release proof. Trace is truncated, so absence of candidate events does not prove no earlier run.
- ISS-2 SOURCE_INSPECTION: output-run.js reads getXml229CandidateAttempt, but no production caller records attempts. Existing audit cannot distinguish unattempted from an unrecorded failure.
- ISS-3 SOURCE_INSPECTION: initial current() refusal silently returns; stale completion can leave running true. Object-reference checks can reject equivalent input replacements. Hypothesis that simple wrapper reads always replace masterContext was FALSIFIED by real-wrapper local execution; do not claim that as Owner-session root cause.
- ISS-4 SOURCE_INSPECTION: auto-run excludes all existing results, even enriched/topology-only results that have no native output. Execution eligibility blockers are not part of the supplied audit.
- QST-1: exact Owner-session Run blocker/attempt outcome is not established. The private model is NOT_RUN.

## Invariants and validation plan

1. Source/Worker generation, original bytes, options, scope and master changes invalidate execution; equivalent object replacement alone does not.
2. One current attempt; auto-run never retries failed attempts; explicit retry remains available.
3. Record IN_PROGRESS/FAILED/SUCCEEDED against the actual session. Publish CII only after existing independent native verification and a final currentness check.
4. Source replacement discards late output and cannot overwrite another attempt or its running state.
5. UI reports pre-conversion blockers separately from post-conversion release HOLD. Weight decisions are never changed by this work.

Validation ledger: current real-wrapper read reproduction PASS/LOCAL_EXECUTION/IMPLEMENTATION_COUPLED (master identity remained stable; hypothesis falsified). Private source/native CII NOT_RUN/NOT_OBSERVED/NONE. New dispatch/failure/drift/retry/auto-run tests and unchanged native-boundary regression pending.

## Recovery and Appendix A

Not a takeover of PR347: merged predecessor retained. New implementation uses exact-main source. A1 trace: Worker completion -> Final packet -> native converter -> independent emitted-byte reconciliation -> currentness -> publication. A2 falsifier: real wrapper showed no unconditional master churn; next isolates explicit equivalent replacement, source drift and no-op dispatch. A3 protect readNativeFinalPacket, independent reconciliation and native output re-attestation. A4 mocked converter responses are control-flow evidence only, never engineering acceptance. A5 surgical scope: output Run action wiring, a small action/context module, automatic scheduling diagnostics, paired docs and focused tests. Future incoming engineering implementer must re-ground and qualify independently; these notes are not model answers or delegated authority.

Changed-file ledger at this checkpoint: this unique report only. No implementation mutation yet.

## Implementation checkpoint

- Extracted the native click action into a bounded real production consumer; retains actual runXml229NativeCiiMassCandidate -> native converter -> independent reconciliation. Session-specific attempt receipt and bounded chronology now record requested/succeeded/failed, including initial refusals.
- Source-currentness captures original XML/JSON/file identity, configuration/master values, selected-source receipts, scope/options and Worker identity. Equivalent immutable replacements/config key order no longer falsely invalidate; real changes still discard output. Filtered views refuse full-source native execution.
- Finally clears the action-owned running indicator even after source/Worker drift. Same-session errors are visible and explicit retry is possible. Duplicate dispatch cannot publish twice.
- An enriched-only or topology-only prior result no longer prevents a first automatic native attempt; failed results/CII/attempted sessions remain non-retrying.
- UI and exported audit show execution blockers separately from the passive native release HOLD. Canonical readiness receives actual attempt evidence. No native output authorization rules changed.

Validation: Node24 local 50/50 PASS via `node --experimental-vm-modules --test tests/xml229-run-hold-audit.test.mjs tests/xml-cii-229-canonical-output-run-readiness.test.mjs tests/xml229-run-auto-native.test.mjs`; LOCAL_EXECUTION / IMPLEMENTATION_COUPLED. Includes 13 new action/control tests through the real state wrappers, existing source-bound re-attestation, failure redaction and root/docs assertions. Initial test fixture used Name instead of Branchname and failed a selection-drift assertion; corrected the synthetic fixture to the actual schema, no production gate weakened. Earlier missing mirror files were workspace materialization gaps, then retrieved and rerun. Root/docs original parity verified before changes, six changed pairs synchronized. Syntax and whitespace checks PASS. Node22, full served module graph/Chromium and real private native output remain NOT_RUN locally until CI/Owner execution.

Changed-file ledger: output-run.js root/docs (wire action, controls/audit evidence); output-run-readiness.js root/docs (forward candidate); run-auto-native.mjs root/docs (enriched-only scheduling); native-run-action/context/eligibility.mjs root/docs (new orchestration/currentness/blockers); native-run-action.test.mjs (explicitly fake converter for control-flow tests only); run-hold-audit.test.mjs (include dispatch tests and verify moved guard); run-auto-native.test.mjs (follow moved guard); output-run-audit-browser.mjs (downloaded execution blockers); this recovery report. Backup utility receipts retained locally; unchanged fetched dependencies and workflow are not part of the PR.

Disposition: implementation candidate complete for this bounded follow-up; no claim that Owner private conversion is reproduced or repaired. A decisive new audit contains execution.blockerIds and actual nativeCandidate/failureCode. Continued native engineering HOLD until real source-bound output passes existing independent reconciliation.

## Draft PR allocation

PR348: https://github.com/reallakshman19/3D_Converters/pull/348
Branch: fix/xml229-native-run-dispatch-20261028. Implementation head: 95a82a9d80b810da5c4207d472971634a0d6634f. Owner private native source remains unavailable; no independent acceptance. Implementation-head targeted Node22/24 PASS; Chromium in progress. Separate native workflow 66/67 pass including actual Python native/source-to-CII reconciliation; one source-location assertion still searched output-run.js for receipt.generationId after the guard moved into native-run-context.mjs. Updated that assertion to trace UI -> action -> context and verify the unchanged exact generation check. Classified INTRODUCED_BY_PR / test-anchor relocation; native behavior did not fail. This report and status/claim synchronization are metadata only after that tested implementation.

Appendix A continuation challenge anchors: A1 trace executeXml229NativeRun -> runXml229NativeCiiMassCandidate -> reconcileXml229ActualCiiAgainstFinal -> buildStandaloneOutputRunReadiness and prove no release from candidate telemetry; A2 reproduce why an enriched-only result suppresses the predecessor auto-run and verify once-only dispatch; A3 mutate original source/selected receipt/Worker during the native await and prove zero downloads; A4 distinguish explicitly fake runner control-flow tests from real native byte/owner reconciliation and obtain actual original-source evidence; A5 keep the next diff in the exact Run orchestration domain, preserve native writer/Final authority and reconcile older PR329/312 before integration. Required evidence: exact-head execution, source anchors, expected result and falsifier for each. Scoring follows root AGENTS.md (6+5+4+3+2 per challenge; >=92 total, >=17 each); no independent takeover score claimed here.

CI correction checkpoint: tests/xml229-native-cii-real-cli-e2e.test.mjs added to changed-file ledger solely to follow the generation guard into its extracted production module; genuine Python converter and tampered-byte expectations are unchanged. Current implementation still 95a82a9; next commit contains test-anchor correction plus recovery/status/claim metadata. Exact new-head checks are required.
