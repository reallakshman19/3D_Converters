# Work Report: PR #339

## 1. Mission and Scope
- **PR**: https://github.com/reallakshman19/3D_Converters/pull/339
- **Mission**: Fix native converter failure `CII_NATIVE_PHYSICAL_OWNER_MISSING` preventing the `Download .cii` button from unlocking in XML→CII 2019 Standalone.
- **Root Cause**: Non-terminal / branch-inlet nodes with `Endpoint="1"` and `Rigid="2"` (such as Node 2810 at the start of branch `/ASIM-1885-PL-3"-S8812701-91261M7-01/B2` in `PL-01_XML.xml`) leaked into physical component census because `xml229-preview-engineering-fact-producer.mjs`, `xml229-original-physical-census-worker.mjs`, and `xml229-r2-physical-transfer-manifest.mjs` checked only `isXmlCiiWeightReviewNode` and `isXmlCiiWeightReviewConnectionEligible`, omitting `isXmlCiiWeightReviewEndpoint(node)`. Because CAESAR II elements are directed `from_node -> to_node` with rigid attributes attached at `to_node` (Endpoint 2), no rigid edge in CAESAR II can have Endpoint 1, causing `verify_emitted_native_masses` to find 0 matching native owners for Endpoint 1 components.
- **Scope**:
  - Enforce `isXmlCiiWeightReviewEndpoint(node)` across fact producer, original physical census worker, and physical transfer manifest.
  - Maintain exact byte parity with `docs/tabs/...` mirrors.
  - Add end-to-end integration and unit tests covering branch-inlet Endpoint 1 nodes.
  - Zero Python modifications in `converters/scripts/`.
  - DO NOT MERGE without explicit owner authorization.

## 2. Current Implementation and Partial Work
- Base commit: `39a6881d0` (`origin/main`).
- Work branch: `fix/xml229-endpoint-physical-owner-20261025`.
- PR #339 opened as Draft (DO NOT MERGE).
- Verified on real model `PL-01_XML.xml` (296,828 bytes): 29 physical components correctly enumerated with 1:1 match to native rigid edges. Full end-to-end Python binding and independent JavaScript reconciliation pass with `nativeCiiReleaseAuthorized: true`.

## 3. Active Findings, Risks, Decisions, and Questions
- **Decision**: Reuse existing pure function `isXmlCiiWeightReviewEndpoint` exported by `converters/xml-cii2019-core/weight-match-model.js`.
- **Finding**: In CAESAR II, all rigid elements represent the element leading into `to_node` (`Endpoint=2`). Inlet nodes with `Endpoint=1` at branch start cannot be weight owners.
- **Risk**: None. All existing 40 unit and contract tests continue to pass; tests expecting Endpoint 0 or Endpoint 2 remain intact.

## 4. Current Hypothesis and Falsifier
- **Hypothesis**: Excluding `Endpoint 1` nodes via `isXmlCiiWeightReviewEndpoint` aligns the physical component census with the actual CAESAR II rigid element graph, resolving `CII_NATIVE_PHYSICAL_OWNER_MISSING` and allowing `Download .cii` to unlock automatically.
- **Falsifier**: If any test fails, if census drift occurs between fact producer and worker, or if `verify_emitted_native_masses` fails on `PL-01_XML.xml`.

## 5. Authority and Invariants
- `TAKEOVER_AUTHORITY`: `STANDARD`.
- Strict file length limits: < 300 lines for new files, < 40 lines for functions.
- Named exports only; no default exports.
- Exact byte parity between root files and `docs/` mirrors.
- Zero python changes in `converters/scripts/`.
