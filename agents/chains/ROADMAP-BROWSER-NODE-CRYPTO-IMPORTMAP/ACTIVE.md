ROOT_CAUSE: The standalone Roadmap Chromium fixture imported the Roadmap controller without the application import map. Its project-schema dependency graph statically imports node:crypto, so Chromium attempted unsupported direct node:crypto loading even though the actual application shell maps that specifier to core/browser-node-crypto.js.
PATCH_STATUS: HOSTED_NODE_AND_RENDERED_CHROMIUM_PASS
PATCH_SCOPE: tests/browser/vibration-roadmap-interaction.html adds the application-equivalent node:crypto import-map entry; next leg adds focused repository-native contract coverage only.

CURRENT_BLOCKER: The Roadmap browser-harness defect is closed, but PR728 has not yet exercised the broader Vibration Production Freeze Validation because the existing fixture path does not match that workflow's path filter.
EXACT_NEXT_ACTION: Add tests/vibration-roadmap-browser-importmap-contract.test.mjs to prove application/fixture node:crypto mapping parity and trigger the existing production-freeze workflow; inspect exact-head Stage 4, full Node, and Chromium results; do not edit workflow YAML or merge without explicit Owner authority.
