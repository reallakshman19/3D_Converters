# Active issue chain

## Current state

EP-0016 is synchronized. Implementation remains complete pending validation. Exact production-module execution now promotes BM-003 to PASS and advances BM-002 to PARTIAL_PASS_SCALE_PATH. Prior bounded evidence remains: BM-001 PASS, BM-005 PARTIAL_PASS_11K, BM-006 PASS, BM-007 PASS. BM-004, BM-008 and BM-009 remain NOT_RUN_ENVIRONMENT_BLOCKED; BM-002 still needs full Python CLI E2E and BM-005 still needs 50k/100k capacity execution.

## Preserved safety/authority boundaries

- Writer kg→CII scale remains `10`; exact invocation runtime emits one scale and the current Python writer consumes that scale once. Full CLI E2E remains open.
- Rigid-weight precedence is Final > Match-1 > legacy > source, with legacy numeric evidence preserved unchanged; this now has exact runtime PASS evidence.
- Empirical validation remains read-only and exact ±30% remains within threshold; BM-004 executable evidence is still open.
- Branch→Line ambiguity and designator mutation remain fail-closed.
- B31.3 automatic Preview remains fail-closed unless strict VERIFIED/PROJECT_APPROVED factor authority (or complete controlled manual fallback) exists.
- Authority migration clears only derived caches and never clears imported masters, mappings, support config, or user evidence.

## Exact next action

Keep PR #770 draft and unmerged. Continue qualification-only with BM-008 B31.3 provenance/numerical controls or materialize the BM-004 empirical estimator/model/master closure. Keep BM-002 partial until a full writer E2E executes, BM-005 partial until 50k/100k executes, and BM-009/final readiness blocked until the canonical focused/full suite executes in a trusted complete checkout. Patch production only if an executed test identifies a concrete first wrong boundary.
