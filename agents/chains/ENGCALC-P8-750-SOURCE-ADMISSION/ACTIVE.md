BENCHMARK_STATUS: LEG-004 supporting reproduction PASS 28/28; exact authenticated focused tests NOT_RUN; issue/checklist authority aligned
CURRENT_BLOCKER: Independent PR review, exact authenticated PR #751 focused Node execution, and one real independently accepted controlled source are unavailable.
LEG_DIAGNOSIS: LEG-004 requires PROJECT_CONTROLLED at public pre-review fingerprinting and preserves state-independent fingerprint verification only after admission requires INDEPENDENTLY_CHECKED.
EXACT_NEXT_ACTION: Obtain independent review of PR #751 and run `node --test tests/flange-face-binding-source-admission.test.mjs tests/flange-face-binding-source-register.test.mjs` on an authenticated exact #751 checkout when available. Do not merge without explicit Owner authorization; keep #750 open until a real accepted source exists.
